> **Warning**: this tool's development is extremely volatile. It is not currently recommended for use.

rapture is a tool for visualizing large point datasets as rasters. This tool is inspired by datashader, rasterly, and similar tooling.


The example below is generated by calling:
```
rapture -i="path/to/example.geojson" -p="POPULATION_2020" -w=1000 -h=600 -o="docs/pts.png""
```

        - [ ] Lines
        - [ ] Polygons
    - [ ] Basemaps
    - [X] Color Ramps
    - [X] Property Selection (somewhat)
- Statistics
    - [X] Density (somewhat)
    - [ ] Custom Functions

## Current Issues

This section comprises issues I'm working to solve currently, and any additional braindumping:

- Need a better parser for GeoJSON (and other vector data formats), including handling their properties better.
- Introduce concurrency via goroutines + channels. (maybe for cell processing?)
- Organize project more accurately -- it's currently a mess, though I anticipate this to resolve itself as the project matures.
- How to incorporate better configuration, YAML/TOML/etc? (down the road)
- Actually start write unit tests...
