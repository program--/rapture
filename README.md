> **Warning**: this tool's development is extremely volatile. It is not currently recommended for use.

rapture is a tool for visualizing large point datasets as rasters. This tool is inspired by datashader, rasterly, and similar tooling.


The example below is generated by calling:
```
rapture -i="path/to/example.geojson" -p="POPULATION_2020" -w=1000 -h=600 -padding=100 -o="docs/pts.png""
```
